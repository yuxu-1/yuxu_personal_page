I am a Ph.D. student at [the Eric CompBio Lab](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=profile&id=ericluzhang). My current research centers around computational genomics and metabolomics. I am interested in designing biological foundation models based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g., large language models) and omics data to address the challenges in genomic and metabolomic applications. Feel free to email me if you are interest with my research topics.
