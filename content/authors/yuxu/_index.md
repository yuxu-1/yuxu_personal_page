I am a Ph.D. candidate at [the Eric CompBio Lab](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=profile&id=ericluzhang). My current research centers around computational genomics and metabolomics. I am interested in designing biological foundation models based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g., large language models) and multi-omics to address the challenges in computational biology. Feel free to email me if you are interest with my research topics.
