I am a Ph.D. student at [the Eric CompBio Lab](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/v1/?page=profile&id=ericluzhang). My current research centers around computational genomics and *in silico* drug discovery. I am interested in designing novel algorithms based on state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., large language models) to decipher complex biological processes from single-cell omics data.
